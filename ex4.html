5/31 Toby's solution:

1. make html ng.js app
2. make module
3. make controller w/ scope parameter
4. link body to ng-app="my-app"
5. display heroHealth
scope. drafgonHea = 20
scope . hear hearlth = 10
in body display health

hero {{dragon Hearth}}
dragon{{dragonHealth}}

create fight/flight fucntion attached to 2 buttons

for flight function use random number
     if (num > 0.5)
     scope.dragon Hear -= 5;
     elsescopt herHeat -= 5;

make function checkWinner (doesnt' have to be part of scope)
function checkWinner();
          if scopt.dragonHeal <= 0
          scope.message = you win
          fi scopt.heroHealth <= 0
          scope.message = you lose

Hints
1. Study angular-examples/4-heads-tails.html game and angular-examples/7-guess-number-2.html.
2. Math.random() returns a random number between 0 and 1. It will return a number greater than 0.5 with a 50/50 chance.
